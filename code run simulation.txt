==================================================
Triage Assessment Result
Risk Level: MEDIUM
Calculated Score: 10.50
--------------------------------------------------
Recommendation:
Schedule a routine appointment with your primary care physician soon.

Score Calculation Breakdown for this Run:

Fever (3.0 weight) x Moderate (1.5 multiplier): 4.5
Sore Throat (1.0 weight) x Severe (2.0 multiplier): 2.0
Fatigue (2.0 weight) x Moderate (1.5 multiplier): 3.0
Age/Duration Factors: 0.0 (Age \< 65, Duration \< 7 days)
Total Score: $4.5 + 2.0 + 3.0 = 9.5$
Result: $9.5$ is between the thresholds of $5.0$ and $15.0$, resulting in MEDIUM Risk.
Performance: The time is negligible (well under the 1-second requirement).

This demonstration shows how the modular code structure successfully delivers a result while meeting the key non-functional requirements.
